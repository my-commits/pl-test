# pl-test
A repository with a simple comparison of programming languages.
## Evaluation method
A program will be written in each language. The following criteria will be checked during the writing process:
### 1 Ease of learning and community support:
If I need up to 1 hour to study, 4 stars. From 1 to 2 - 3 stars. From 2 to 4 - 2 stars. From 4 to 8 - one star. More than 8 - 0.
### 2 Performance and scalability:
If the performance is at the C level, then this is +2 stars. If the performance is from 10 to 100 times worse - + 1 star. if it's even worse, then 0 stars. If there is native and efficient work with multithreading, then this is 2 stars. if multithreading is supported, but by third-party libraries, or limited, then 1.
### 3 Security and paradigm support:
Type safety is 1 star. Null Safety is 2 stars. Support for any of the modern paradigms is 1 star. Support for most modern paradigms is 2 stars.
### 4 Cross-platform and compatibility:
One star for each platform:
- Mobile
- Desktop
- Web
- Console
## Python
